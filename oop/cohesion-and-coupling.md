# Object Oriented Programming - Basic Concepts

## Cohesion
It's the specialization degree of a software piece (component, interface, class, method). I can releate this concept to design principles such as Single Responsability, Interface Segregation and Opened-Close. In OOP we look for high cohesion.

## Coupling
It's the dependency degree that a software piece has to another. I can relate this concept to design principles such as Dependency Inversion and Liskov Substitution. In OOP we look for low coupling.
